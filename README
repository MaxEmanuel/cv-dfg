The dfg-cv package provides a LaTeX version of the DFG's cross-program CV template – mandatory for all funding programs since March 1, 2023.

The package is based on its RTF counterpart as provided by the DFG: https://www.dfg.de/formulare/53_200_elan/index.jsp

There are two class options:
- 'checked', if 'true' ticks the checkbox in the final consent form
- 'walterbenjamin', if 'true', adds school data to the qualification section

Furthermore, there are more compact versions of enumerate (compactEnumerate) and itemize (compactItemize) to have a bit more space. :)

The attached example, 'cv.tex', aims to be self-explanatory.

Further information on formatting choices and the content can be found here: https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/principles_dfg_funding/equal_opportunities/applicants_funding_recipients/personal_circumstances/faq_cv/index.html
